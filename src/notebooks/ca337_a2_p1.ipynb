They are right, as this is exactly what happened with me. Would definitely recommend this movie\",\n","             \"A wonderful little production. The filming technique is very unassuming- very old-time-BBC fashion and gives a comforting, and sometimes discomforting, sense of realism to the entire piece.\",\n","             \"I thought this was a wonderful way to spend time on a too hot summer weekend, sitting in the air conditioned theater and watching a light-hearted comedy. The plot is simplistic, but the dialogue is witty and the characters are likable.\",\n","             \"Basically there's a family where a little boy (Jake) thinks there's a zombie in his closet & his parents are fighting all the time. This movie is slower than a soap opera... and suddenly, Jake decides to become Rambo and kill the zombie. A film to forget.\",\n","             \"This is a movie that seems to be telling us what money, power and success do to people in the different situations we encounter. Stylishly, the film has a sophisticated\",\n","             \"Probably my all-time favorite movie, a story of selflessness, sacrifice and dedication to a noble cause, but it's not preachy or boring. It just never gets old, despite my having seen it some 15 or more times in the last 25 years.\",\n","             \"I sure would like to see a resurrection of a up dated Seahunt series with the tech they have today it would bring back the kid excitement in me.I grew up on black and white TV and Seahunt with Gunsmoke were my hero's every week.\",\n","             \"This show was an amazing, fresh & innovative idea in the 70's when it first aired. The first 7 or 8 years were brilliant, but things dropped off after that. By 1990, the show was not really funny anymore, and it's continued its decline further to the complete waste of time it is today.\",\n","             \"Encouraged by the positive comments about this film on here I was looking forward to watching this film. Bad mistake. I've seen 950+ films and this is truly one of the worst of them - it's awful in almost every way: editing, pacing, storyline, 'acting,' and soundtrack.\",\n","             \"If you like original gut wrenching laughter you will like this movie. If you are young or old then you will love this movie, hell even my mom liked it. Great Camp!!!\",\n","             \"Phil the Alien is one of those quirky films where the humour is based around the oddness of everything rather than actual punchlines. At first it was very odd and pretty funny but as the movie progressed I didn't find the jokes or oddness funny anymore.\",\n","             \"I saw Psycho when it came out and I loved that the star, Janet Leigh, was bumped off early in the film. I sat up and took notice at that point. Since screenwriters are making up the story, make it up to be as scary as possible and not from a well-worn formula. There are no rules.\",\n","             \"If you wanna stay true to Bolls shenanigans then go and see this movie you will not be disappointed it delivers the true Boll experience, meaning most of it will suck.\",\n","             \"The cast played Shakespeare. Shakespeare lost. I appreciate that this is trying to bring Shakespeare to the masses, but why ruin something so good.\",\n","             \"This a fantastic movie of three prisoners who become famous. One of the actors is george clooney and I'm not a fan but this roll is not bad. Another good thing about the movie is the soundtrack. I recommand this movie to everybody. Greetings Bart\",\n","             \"Kind of drawn in by the erotic scenes, only to realize this was one of the most amateurish and unbelievable bits of film I've ever seen. Sort of like a high school film project.\",\n","             \"Some films just simply should not be remade. This is one of them. In and of itself it is not a bad film. But it fails to capture the flavor and the terror of the 1963 film of the same title.\",\n","             \"This movie made it into one of my top 10 most awful movies. Horrible. There wasn't a continuous minute where there wasn't a fight with one monster or another.\",\n","             \"I remember this film,it was the first film i had watched at the cinema the picture was dark in places i was very nervous it was back in 74/75 my Dad took me my brother & sister to Newbury cinema in Newbury Berkshire England. If anyone knows where to find this on DVD etc please let me know.\",\n","             \"An awful film! It must have been up against some real stinkers to be nominated for the Golden Globe.
